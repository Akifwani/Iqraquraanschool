Project Details for Iqraa Quran School Website

Iqraa Quran School is an educational website based in Chicago, SA. The client approached me with the requirement to design a website that provides a seamless experience for students, parents, and teachers. They required a website that includes admission, registration, and enrollment functionalities and serves as a complete school management system.

Client Requirements:

The client wanted a website that is modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly. They required a website that includes an admission and enrollment system, student registration, and attendance management functionalities. They also wanted the website to have a dashboard for teachers, students, and parents to track progress and communicate with each other.

Functions:

To meet the client’s requirements, we designed a website on the WordPress platform. The website has a clean and modern design with a focus on user experience. Here are some of the key functions of the website:

1. Admission and Enrollment: The website includes a complete admission and enrollment system. The system allows students to apply for admission online, and the school administrators can review the applications, accept or reject them, and notify the students accordingly.

2. Student Registration: The website has a registration system that allows students to register for courses online. The system provides detailed information about the courses, including course duration, fees, and schedule, making it easy for students to choose the right course.

3. Attendance Management: The website has an attendance management system that allows teachers to take attendance online. The system provides real-time attendance reports, making it easy for school administrators to track attendance and monitor student progress.

4. Dashboard: The website includes a dashboard for teachers, students, and parents. The dashboard provides easy access to important information, including student progress reports, grades, attendance, and course schedules. The dashboard also allows users to communicate with each other, making it easy for teachers to provide feedback to students and for parents to monitor their children’s progress.

5. Blog: The website has a blog section that provides useful information about the school, including upcoming events, student achievements, and school news.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, we are proud to have designed a website that meets the client’s requirements and exceeds their expectations. The website not only serves as a complete school management system but also provides useful information to students, parents, and teachers. The admission and enrollment system, student registration, and attendance management functionalities make it easy for the school administrators to manage the school’s operations efficiently. We are confident that the website will help Iqraa Quran School grow its business and attract more students and parents
